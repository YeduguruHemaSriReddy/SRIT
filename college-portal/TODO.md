# TODO List for Fixing College Portal Errors

## 1. Fix Imports in App.js
- [x] Change import from `Navbar` to `{ Navigation }` from "./components/Navigation"
- [x] Update JSX from `<Navbar />` to `<Navigation />`

## 2. Rename AdminDashboard File
- [x] File is readable as .jsx despite listing as .jsk (likely display error)

## 3. Verify and Restart
- [x] Check if Tailwind issues are resolved (no bg-background found)
- [x] Run `npm install` and `npm start` in client directory
